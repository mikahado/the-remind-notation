# The Remind Notation (TRN)

The Remind Notation is a minimal, compact notation method designed for musicians performing live or jamming with others. It simplifies the presentation of chords and song structure into a single line of text, while also offering a concise display of song lyrics to avoid mid-performance scrolling.

## Background

The idea for TRN emerged from personal frustration during live performances and jam sessions where accessing chords and lyrics required manual scrolling or complicated pedal setups. The goal was to create a streamlined solution that could fit an entire song on a single page, enhancing the performance experience for musicians.

## Philosophy

TRN operates on the principle that musicians perform best when playing from memory, allowing for more expressive and heartfelt performances. It serves as a reminder rather than a strict guide, enabling musicians to focus on the nuances of a song such as dynamics and transitions while maintaining cohesion within the group.

## Features

- Compact notation format eliminates the need for scrolling mid-song.
- Serves as a reference for musicians who have already learned a song.
- Facilitates consistent and accurate performances.

## Notation Syntax

- Each element of the notation carries meaning and is separated by spaces.
- Key symbols include underscore for separating parts, parentheses for transitions or fills, asterisk for repetition, and arrows for structural notes.


## Usage

TRN is intended for musicians who have already learned a song and seek a compact reminder of its structure during performance or rehearsal.
