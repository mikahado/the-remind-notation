I give her all my love  That's all I do  
And if you saw my love  You'd love her too  I love her

She gives me everything  And tenderly  
The kiss my lover brings  She brings to me  And I love her

A love like ours  Could never die  As long as I  Have you near me

Bright are the stars that shine  Dark is the sky  
I know this love of mine  Will never die  And I love her
