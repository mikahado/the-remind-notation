<p class="lyrics">
Thinkin' back in time / When love was only in my mind / I realize, 
Ain't no second chance / You've got to hold on to romance / Don't let it slide   

There's a special kind of magic in the air /  
When you find another heart that needs to share  

Baby, come to me / Let me put my arms around you  
This was meant to be / And I'm, oh so glad, I found you
Need you every day / Gotta have your love around me  
Baby, always stay / 'Cause I can't go back to livin' without you 

Spendin every dime / To keep you talkin' on the line / That's how it was  
And all those walks together / Out in any kind of weather / Just because  

There's a brand-new way / Of looking at your life
When you know that love / Is standing by your side ...  

The nights can be cold  There's a chill to ev'ry evenin' When you're all alone  
Don't talk anymore  'Cause you know that I'll be here  To keep you warm
