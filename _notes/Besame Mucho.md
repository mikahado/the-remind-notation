Besame, besame mucho. Each time I cling to your kiss I hear music divine.
Besame, besame mucho. Love me forever say that you'll always be mine   

Dearest one if you should leave me. Then each little dream will take wings and my life will be through
Besame, besame mucho. Love me forever and make all my dreams come true   

This joy is something new my arms enfolding you. Never new this love before     
I never thought i'd be holding you close to me. Whispering it's you I adore
