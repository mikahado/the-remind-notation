Crazy I'm crazy for feelin so loney / I'm crazy, crazy for feelin so blue / I knew you'd love me as long as you wanted / and then someday you'd leave me for somebody new

Worry, why do I let myself worry / Wondrin, what in the world did I do?

I'm crazy for thinking that my love could hold you / I'm crazy for tryin and crazy for cryin and / I'm crazy for lovin you
