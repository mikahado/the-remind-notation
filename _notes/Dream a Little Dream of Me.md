Stars shining bright above you. Night breezes seem to whisper "I love you"  
Birds singin' in the sycamore trees. Dream a little dream of me.

Say "Night-ie night" and kiss me  Just hold me tight and tell me you'll miss me  
While I'm alone and blue as can be  Dream a little dream of me

Stars fading but I linger on, dear  Still craving your kiss  
I'm longing to linger 'til dawn, dear  Just saying this

Sweet dreams 'til sunbeams find you  Sweet dreams that leave all worries behind you  
But in your dreams, whatever they be  Dream a little dream of me
