If it were up to me / I'd reverse gravity / I wanna sink into the sky, in the clouds and fly / Push the boundaries of the atmosphere and leave here / Let the wind caress me with cold fingertips and icy lips / Tie me to the ground, before I come unwound

If all were up to me, I'd twist up the time / I'd sink into your mind, your haunts and find / Cushioning darkening atmosphere, to leave here. / Let each head address our notes / in empty envelopes / Unleash the ground for our strokes of sound
