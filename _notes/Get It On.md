Well, you're dirty and sweet  Clad in black, don't look back and I love you  
You're dirty and sweet, oh yeah  Well, you're slim and you're weak  
You've got the teeth of the hydra upon you  You're dirty, sweet and you're my girl

Get it on, bang a gong, get it on  

Well, you're built like a car  You've got a hubcap diamond star halo  
You're built like a car, oh yeah  Well, you're an untamed youth  
That's the truth with your cloak full of eagles  You're dirty, sweet and you're my girl

Well, you're windy and wild  You've got the blues in your shoes and your stockings  
You're windy and wild, oh yeah  Well you're built like a car  
You've got a hubcap diamond star halo  You're dirty, sweet and you're my girl
