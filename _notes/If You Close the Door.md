If you close / the door / the night could last forever / Leave the sun / shine out and say hello to never (Leave the wine / glass out and drink a toast to never)

All the people are dancing / and they're having such fun / I wish it could happen to me ( Oh, someday I know someone will look into my eyes and say / "Hello, you're my very special one" )

But if you close / the door / I'd never have to see the day again

Dark party bars, shiny Cadillac cars / And the people on subways and trains / Looking gray in the rain as they stand disarrayed / Oh, but people look well in the dark
