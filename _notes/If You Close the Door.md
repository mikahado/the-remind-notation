If you close the door / the night could last forever / Leave the sunshine out and say hello to never (Leave the wineglass out and drink a toast to never)

All the people are dancing / and they're having such fun / I wish it could happen to me

But if you close the door / I'd never have to see the day again

Oh, someday, I know someone will look into my eyes / 
And say, "Hello, you're my very special one"

Dark party bars, shiny Cadillac cars / And the people on subways and trains / Looking gray in the rain as they stand disarrayed / Oh, but people look well in the dark
