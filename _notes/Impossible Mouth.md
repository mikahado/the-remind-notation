You had died / Fourteen hours ago / Now Here you are
Talking out / Of your impossible mouth
Why / Don't you let go?

Because we had so much to say / That never crossed our lips / Because we had so much to do / That never came to / Because we had not enough time . . . .

To do what we wanted / Be who we wanted / Love who we wanted / See when we wanted / Live how we wanted / Need when we wanted / Know why we wanted . . .

Back on the mortal sphere / the human sphere / the animal sphere / The sphere!
