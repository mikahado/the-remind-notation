Animals dreaming of animals / Mouths looking into mouths / Musicians performing for musicians / And nothing adds up to nine

But if I take my vitamin C / Say goodbye to my Queen / We'll combine at the carbon tide / And if you touch my skin /  Surely we'll come again, and again, and again

Identity left me fractured again / Passed the cyclical eyes, a humming bird / Signified, countless times, O all my life / All real, real, real!

Barrels looking into Barrels / Time consuming Time / Elephants thinking of elephants / And nothing adds up to 9!

Hands drawing hands / Whores hooking up with whores / As I passed the grocery store, aye yai yai! / All the planets aligned
