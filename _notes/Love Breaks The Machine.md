*Of Montreal*

Key: 
### - Bm > G Em ( am Bm7 Cm7 ) 
### - Cm7 Eb ( F# ) 

Love breaks the machine, everything's half apart, what can it mean?  
How can I trust my fractious heart knowing I have the enemy gene?  
Oh, love breaks the machine, everything's half a dream, how can it be?  
Everything's born in shame, it's not just me, particle way duality  
  
I know that we'll never survive this little victory  

How can we ever evolve when our gods are so primitive?  
They destroy our hope for peace, Hope for love, ooh
