*Of Montreal* - Key: G
### - G Bm Em Bm G (Bm7 Cm7) 
### - Cm7 Eb (F#) 

Love breaks the machine / Everything's half apart, what can it mean?  
How can I trust my fractious heart / Knowing I have the enemy gene?  
Oh, love breaks the machine / Everything's half a dream, how can it be?  
Everything's born in shame / it's not just me / particle way duality  
  
I know that we'll never survive this little victory 
(How can we ever evolve when our gods are so primitive?) /  
They destroy our hope for peace / Hope for love
