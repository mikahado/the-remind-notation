Well you sure didn't look like you were having any fun / With that heavy-metal gaze they'll have to measure in tons / And when you look up at the sky / All you see are zeros /
And all you see are zeros and ones

You took my hand and led me down / To watch the kewpie doll parade / And we let the kittens lick our hair / And drank our chalky lemonade / It's not that I just didn't care, I must admit I was afraid / And I'm awfully glad my finger's resting gently on the masterfade

The masterfade, I coulda played along / The masterfade, I coulda played Mah Jongg
But it just takes too long / And I just can't remember / Which way the east wind blows () Does it matter? / If we're all matter / What's it matter, does it matter / If we're all matter when we're done? / When the sky is full of zeros and ones 

(When you're lying on the ground / Staring up at an inverted compass / I mean Christ, who knows?)

I saw you standing all alone in the electrostatic rain / I thought at last I'd found a situation you can't explain / With GPS you know it's all just a matter of degrees / Your happiness won't find you underneath that canopy of trees

If the green grass is six and the soybeans are seven / The junebugs are eight, the weeds and thistles are eleven / And if the one's just hold their place, the zero's make a smiley face / When they come floating down from the heavens

You took my hand and led me down / To watch a papillon parade / We let the kittens lick our hair / And drank our chalky lemonade / You squeezed my hand and told me softly that I shouldn't be afraid / 'Cause all the while your finger's resting gently on the masterfade
