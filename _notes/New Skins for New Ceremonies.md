I was pressed up against / your deep wood back that night / heard your sound waves / on my ribcage / you slept beside

Call it what you will / It was there still / (On our minds)

I've been to the other side / it looked the same /
it looked the same / and as the curtains close / whispers were all / we heard from the stage.

No, I'll never understand / Just make the demands / 
of a man of fire / Followed into the night / my eyes aligned / by a hit of the sun 

We rivers that bend / Ever a wave, ever a wind / And though your eyes are closed / You saw the animals /  Prowling in the night / my eyes aligned / by the hit of the sun

Fade conversations / of oh, who knows
