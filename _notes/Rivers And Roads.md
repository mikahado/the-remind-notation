RiversAndRoads _ C Am ^ F C  _ Am F C 

A year from now, we'll all be gone  All our friends will move away  
And they're goin' to better places  But our friends will be gone away

Nothin' is as it has been  And I miss your face like hell  
And I guess it's just as well  But I miss your face like hell

Ohhh

Been talkin' 'bout the way things change  And my family lives in a different state  
If you don't know what to make of this  Then we will not relate  
So if you don't know what to make of this  Then we will not relate

Rivers and roads  Rivers and roads  Rivers 'til I reach you
