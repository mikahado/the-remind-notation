<p class="lyrics">
Come with me My love To the sea The sea of love  
I wanna tell you How much I love you  

Do you remember When we met That's the day I knew you were my pet  
I wanna tell you How much I love you  

Come with me My love To the sea The sea of love  
I wanna tell you How much I love you... oh, oh
