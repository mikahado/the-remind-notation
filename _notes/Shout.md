Shout  Shout Let it all out  
These are the things I can do without  
Come on  I'm talking to you  Come on

In violent times  You shouldn't have to sell your soul  
In black and white  They really, really ought to know

Those one track minds  That took you for a working boy  
Kiss them goodbye  You shouldn't have to jump for joy  

They gave you life  And in return you gave them hell  
As cold as ice  I hope we live to tell the tale  

And when you've taken down your guard  
If I could change your mind  I'd really love to break your heart
