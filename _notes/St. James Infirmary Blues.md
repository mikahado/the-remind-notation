It was down in old Joe's bar-room, On the corner by the square
The drinks were served as usual And the usual crowd were there
On my left stood big Joe McKennedy His eyes were bloodshot red
He turned to the crowd around him These were the very words he said
Folks, I'm goin' down to St. James Infirmary See my baby there
She's stretched out on a long, white table So sweet, so cold, so fair
Let her go, let her go, God bless her Wherever she may be
She will search this wide world over But she'll never find another sweet man like me
Now, when I die, bury me in my straight-leg britches
Put on a box-back coat and a Stetson hat
Put a twenty-dollar gold piece on my watch chain
So you can let all the boys know I died standing pat
Then give me six crap shooting pall bearers
Let a chorus girl sing me a song
Put a red hot jazz band at the top of my head
So we can raise Hallelujah as we go along
Folks, now that you have heard my story
Say, boy, hand me over another shot of that booze
If anyone should ask you
Tell 'em I've got those St. James Infirmary blues
