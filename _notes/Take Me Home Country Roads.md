Almost heaven / West Virginia / Blue Ridge Mountains / Shenandoah River / Life is old there / older than the trees / Younger than the mountains / growin' like a breeze

Country roads / take me home / To the place I belong / West Virginia / Mountain mama / Take me home / Country roads

All my memories / gather 'round her / Miner's lady / stranger to blue water / Dark and dusty / painted on the sky / Misty taste of moonshine / teardrop in my eye

I hear her voice / in the mornin' hour she calls me / The radio reminds me / of my home far away /
Drivin' down the road / I get a feelin' / That I should've been home yesterday, yesterday
