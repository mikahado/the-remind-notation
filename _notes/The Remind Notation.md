Remind Notation is a minimal, compact notation method for musicians performing live or jamming with other musicians. It provides the chords and structure of a song in a single line of text. In addition, musicians can show the lyrics of a song, also in a compact way to avoid any scrolling mid-song. 

TRN was born out of a frustration I had while performing live, rehearsing, or jamming with friends. If we all wanted to see the chords and lyrics to a song, one of us would have to be the page-turner and scroll up and down the page for everyone. There have been some attempts to solve this with auto-scroll, which is a pain to synchronize to the temp of a song. Or you could hook up a pedal to turn the pages. But I wanted to create a better way, where any average length song could be seen and played on less than a single page. So I invented The Remind Notation, the notation that brings out the best in your performance.  

TRN philosophy is that musicians play better, or at least with more heart, when they play from memory instead of following detailed directions. To use TRN, the musician should already know the nuances of a song, such as how many times to repeat certain parts, or what dynamic to use (soft, loud, etc). They should already know the riffs, solos, fills, and flairs. TRN simply serves as a reminder, to keep the player or the group on the same page, in a compact way that's easy to reference in a live or jam setting. 

Musicians can use The Remind Notation as a reference, or reminder, of the song.

Benefits:
TRN is compact. No more scrolling mid-song. 
Functions as the rails of a song, so you can play it correctly every time. 

Product Purpose: to be used by musicians who have already learned a song

### FAQs

Q: 
How is PRON different than other musical notation?
A: 
PRON excludes any notation mark that indicates time, like bars and rests, or dynamic, like tempo or emotion. The purpose of this notation is only to remind the player of the bare minumum to get correct. The rest leaves the musician up to what they feel best -- they get to bring their own dynamics and self into the song. PRON is ideal for a song to jam with others too. No more mid-song scrolling
