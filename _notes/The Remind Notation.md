## How to Read TRN  

Key symbols include dash for separating parts, parentheses for transitions or fills, carot for repetition, and arrows for rooted progressions.

### Glossary

" - " = dash separates "parts", ie verse, chorus, bridge, instrumental, etc. 

```
ex. 
D C G - F G - Am Em 
Verse - Chorus - Bridge
```

" (    ) " = chords in parens indicate transitions or fills 

```
ex. 
C Am ( F G ) 
parens chords are transition notes
``` 

" 2 " or " 4 ", etc. = number indicates specific amount times to loop

```
ex. 
Am Em 3 
Am Em Am Em Am Em
```

" < or > " = structural note: arrow points to home/root chord to be played first. Then go back and forth with the chords on the opposite side of the operator

```
ex. 
C > Bm F A == Bm C F C A C
ex. 
F < Am C G == F Am F C F G
```

## Features

- Compact notation format eliminates the need for scrolling mid-song.
- Serves as a reference for musicians who have already learned a song.
- Facilitates consistent and accurate performances.

## What TRN is not

TRM encourages musicians to bring more of their self and their memory to the piece. To accomplish this, TRN excludes some common notations.

- No dynamics/articulation (how hard or soft to play)
- No tempo/metre/bars
- No technique (ie, which fingers to use, whether to strum or fingerpick, etc. )
- No repetition count (of how mamy times a section is repeated)
- No tablature

## Background

Hi! I'm Maika, the author of The Remind Notation (and this site). TRN was born out of a frustration I had while performing live, rehearsing, or jamming with friends. If we all wanted to see the chords and lyrics to a song, one of us would have to be the page-turner and scroll up and down the page for everyone. There have been some attempts to solve this with auto-scroll, which is a pain to synchronize to the temp of a song. Or you could hook up a pedal to turn the pages. But I wanted to create a better way, where any average length song could be seen and played on less than a single page. So I invented The Remind Notation, the notation that brings out the best in your performance.  

## Philosophy

TRN philosophy is that musicians play better, or at least with more heart, when they play from memory instead of reading directions. To use TRN, the musician should already know the nuances of a song, such as how many times to repeat certain parts, or what dynamic to use (soft, loud, etc). They should already know the riffs, solos, fills, and flairs. TRN simply serves as a reminder, to keep the player or the group on the same page, in a compact way that's easy to reference in a live or jam setting. 

## FAQs

**Q: How is TRN different from other musical notation?**  
A: TRN omits time and dynamic indicators, focusing solely on chord and structure reminders. It encourages musicians to inject their personal interpretation into the performance, making it ideal for jam sessions.
