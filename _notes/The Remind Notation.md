The Remind Notation is a minimal, compact notation method designed for musicians playing live. TRM simplifies reading chords and song structure, giving an easy-to-read display of chords, structure, and lyrics.

### **üîç How to Read TRN**

Key symbols include:
- "-" for separating parts
- "(  )" for transitions/fills
- "^" for repetition
- "<" or ">" for structural notes

### Glossary

" - " = dash separates parts of a song:

```
C G Am - F G C - Am F G
= Verse - Chorus - Bridge
```

" / " = slash separates parts within a part 

```
- C B7 Ab G7 / C E7 A A7 
= both mini-parts are within the verse
```

" ^ " = carot (up arrow) to loop chords:

```
C G Am F ^ 
= C G Am F C G Am F, etc.
```

" ^2 " or " ^4 ", etc. = loop for a specific times: 

```
Am F ^3 G
= Am F Am F Am F G
```

" (    ) " = transitions/fills 

```
C Am ( F G ) 
= F and G are quarter notes
``` 

" < or > " = structural note: arrow points to home/root chord to be played first. Then go back and forth with the chords on the opposite side of the operator

```
C > Am F G == Am C F C G C
or
G < Em C D == G Em G C G D
```

Note: the above notation short-hand work for a wide variety of chord progressions, but of course, not all! Progressions that do not fit the Remind Notation should be written out explicitly.

## Features

- Compact notation format eliminates the need for scrolling mid-song.
- Serves as a reference for musicians who have already learned a song.
- Facilitates consistent and accurate performances.

## What TRN isn't

TRM encourages memory-based performances. 

- No dynamics/articulation (how hard or soft to play)
- No tempo/metre/bars
- No technique (ie, which fingers to use, whether to strum or fingerpick, etc. )
- No repetition count (of how mamy times a section is repeated)
- No tablature

## Background

Hi! I'm Maika, the author of The Remind Notation (and this site). TRN was born out of a frustration I had while performing live, rehearsing, or jamming with friends. If we all wanted to see the chords and lyrics to a song, one of us would have to be the page-turner and scroll up and down the page for everyone. There have been some attempts to solve this with auto-scroll, which is a pain to synchronize to the temp of a song. Or you could hook up a pedal to turn the pages. But I wanted to create a better way, where any average length song could be seen and played on less than a single page. So I invented The Remind Notation, the notation that brings out the best in your performance.  

## Philosophy

TRN believes musicians play better, or at least with more heart, when they from memory. üß† It's a reminder, not a crutch. Musicians should already know the nuances of the song -- the structure, dynamics, riffs, solos, etc. TRN serves as a reminder, to keep everyone on track in a compact, live-friendly format. üé∂

## FAQs

**Q: How is TRN different from other musical notation?**  
A: TRN omits time and dynamic indicators, focusing solely on chord and structure reminders. It encourages musicians to inject their personal interpretation into the performance, making it ideal for jam sessions.

**Q: Can TRN be used for complex chord progressions or unconventional song structures?**
A: While TRN's shorthand notation is versatile, it may not cover every intricate chord progression or unconventional structure. It's best suited for standard song formats and common chord progressions. For more complex compositions, explicit notation may be required.

**Q: Are there any plans to integrate TRN with digital platforms or music software?**
A: Currently, there are no plans for digital integration, but future developments could explore possibilities for integrating TRN with digital platforms or music software to enhance accessibility and usability for musicians.

**Q: How does TRN address language barriers for multilingual musicians?**
A: TRN's notation system is language-agnostic, primarily relying on symbols and shorthand notation for chords and structure. This makes it accessible to musicians regardless of language proficiency, as long as they understand the symbolic representation of chords and song structure.
