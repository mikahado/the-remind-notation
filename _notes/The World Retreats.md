Hold back Confide among the stars  
We could be the lucky ones If we could only levitate  
Fly low dear Dance beneath the trees   
If only we had oxygen Then we'd begin to breathe  

And we can watch While the beauty takes its toll  
And we can stop While the world retreats   

Lie low dear Fix yourself a life   
We could be the wealthy ones If we could only emigrate  
These walls get closer by the night   
Everything is delicate and everything in flight
