## F ( D# ) D7 Gm A# C _  F dm am C _ (A#m A#)

Feels like the countdown's almost up  Still looking for a hiding place  
Asleep between the jaws of all the lies I'm living  
Way out of my depth fire, I'm fucked  Facing off the closing walls, 
I can't stop dreaming of the same old song

There goes my cool  Back to bite the dust  
Don't care how we make it  As long as we do  
Back to bite the dust  Left out for the taken  
There goes my cool

I gotta shake these waking thoughts  Can't live like an endurance sport  
I can't keep towing the line  And act like I'm still winning  
Stuck in the mood  For giving up  
'Cause nothing hits the spot  When I give it all I've got

So long my cool  . . .

There goes my cool  Back to bite the dust  
Don't know how we'll make it  But we always do
