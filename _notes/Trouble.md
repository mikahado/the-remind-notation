Trouble, oh trouble set me free, I have seen your face and it's to much for today
Trouble, oh trouble cant you see Eating my heart away, and there's nothing much left of me

I drunk your wine You have made your world mine
So won't you be fair Oh won't you be fair
I don't no more of you So wont you be kind to me
And let me go there I have to go there

Trouble oh trouble move away, I have seen your face and it's to much for me today
Trouble oh trouble can't you see You have made me a wreck now won't you leave me in my misery
I've seen your eyes And I have seen death disguised, oh hanging on me

I'm deep and torn I'm shattered and lost and worn
Too shocking to see Too shocking to see
Trouble oh trouble please be kind
I don't wanna fight and I havn't got a lot of time.
