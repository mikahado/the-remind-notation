The clouds didn't look like cotton / they didn't even look like clouds / I was underneath the weather / and my friends looked like a crowd / 
The swimmin' hole was full of rum / I tried to find out why / all I learned, my friend / is you've got to swim before you fly.

I've got two girls / one's in heaven, one's below / one I love with all my heart / and one I do not know.

Two lonesome dudes on an ugly horse / passed by not long ago / They asked me where the action was / I said I did not know / 
And as they disappeared into the brush / I heard the driver say / He's a little slow between the ears / He's always been that way.

Jolly Jane just lays around and listens with her mouth / She's had about a dozen husbands / but the last one just pulled out / 
Now who's gonna bring her dinner / through the weary years ahead? / All she'll get from me is sympathy / got no time to see she's fed.

Cold down on the bayou / they say it's in your mind / But the moccasins are treadin' ice / and leaving strange designs / 
Cajuns say the last time / this happened they weren't here / Aw, Beaumont's full of penguins / and I'm a playin' it by ear.
