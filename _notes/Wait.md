Wait, don't go too early You're tired but everyone's tired
But no one, no one is tired enough Only wait a little and listen

Music of hair, music of pain Music of looms weaving all our loves again
Be there to hear it, it's your only chance

You know that hair will become interesting And pain, pain will become interesting
Second hand gloves will become lovely, lovely again

Oh wait, wait for now - ooh Distrust everything, if you have to
But trust the hours Haven't they carried you everywhere till now?
