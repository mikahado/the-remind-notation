Walking the same way / We were walking the same way / With our hats in our hands / Strings tied to the hats 

On our way to the oceanside / We were away from the, from the city life / 

To the mouth of the cave / To spend the rest of our days / Desiring Nothing, and everything / Nothing and everything we / Ever came to.

Some had no legs / Some had lost their way / In the streets of this town / Where the hills and buildings rise / 

At night we arise / to the lights / from our eyes / Fortunes of pain / giving us all the pleasures / we
Wanted.

When we unplugged the boat / Let the whole damn thing un-float / Our hearts contracted / Giving us all the blood we wanted
