F C G * _ Am D C *

On a rooftop in Brooklyn  At one in the mornin'  
Watchin' the lights flash  In Manhattan  
I see five bridges  The Empire State Building  
And you said something  That I've never forgotten

Lean against railings  Describin' the colors  
And the smells of our homelands  Acting like lovers
How did we get here?  To this point of living  
I held my breath  And you said somethin'

And I'm doin' nothin' wrong  Ridin' in your car  
Your radio playing  We sing up to the eighth floor  
A rooftop, Manhattan  One in the mornin'  
And you said somethin'  That I've never forgotten

You said somethin'  You said somethin'  
You said somethin'  That was really important
