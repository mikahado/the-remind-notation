                  The Remind Notation (TRN) is a streamlined musical shorthand
                  designed to help musicians quickly reference chords, lyrics,
                  and song structure without the need for mid-song scrolling.
                  Itâ€™s a quick memory-aiding tool for those who already know the
                  songs.
                  <small>
                    TRN serves an educational and informative purpose. All lyrics and chords remain the property of their respective artists.

                <h3>How to Use TRN</h3>
                <ol>
                  <li>Learn a song by heart. Use official sheet music or online lablature. And your ears! </li>
                  <li>Graduate to The Remind Notation. While you play, use TRN (pronounced 'turn') to recall chords and lyrics</li>
                  <li>Focus on the music instead of the page. Engage your audience, not the screen. </li>
                </ol>

                <h3>How to Read TRN</h3>
                <p>Key symbols include dash, slash, parenthesis, and caret.</p>

                <h3>Glossary</h3>
                <p>
                  " - " = dash separates <strong>parts</strong> of a song:
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                    <strong>C G Am - F G C - Am F G</strong>
                    <br />
                    = Verse - Chorus - Bridge
                  </p>
                </blockquote>

                <p>
                  " ^ " = caret (up arrow) reminds you to <strong>loop</strong>{' '}
                  previous chords a number of times:
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                    <strong>Am Em^</strong>
                    <br />
                    = Am Em Am Em Am Em, etc.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>C G ^ Am F</strong>
                    <br />= C G C G Am F
                  </p>
                </blockquote>

                <p>
                  " ( ) " = parenthesis reminds you of{' '}
                  <strong>transitions, fills,</strong> or{' '}
                  <strong>alterations</strong>:
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                    <strong>C Am ^ (F G)</strong>
                    <br />= F and G are transition chords, played only once.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>C(7)</strong>
                    <br />
                    = Playing C7th is optional, or played occasionally.
                  </p>
                </blockquote>

                <p>
                  " / " = slash reminds you of <strong>alternations</strong>{' '}
                  between sections:

                <blockquote>

                    <strong>G Em (Am C / D G )</strong>
                    <br />
                    = First time through: G Em Am C<br />
                    = Second time through: G Em D G
                  </p>

                  Note: TRN is short-hand notation for a wide variety of chord
                  progressions, but of course, not all songs will fit perfectly
                  within its rules, so... Use. Your. Memory!

                <h2>Philosophy</h2>
                <p>
                  Musicians play best from memory and heart. The Remind Notation
                  is a simple reminder for songs already well known. It doesn't
                  capture every nuance of a song -- just the essentials to keep
                  everyone on track.
                </p>

                <h2>What TRN is for:</h2>
                <p>
                  It's a reference for musicians who already know the song. Its
                  compact format eliminates mid-song scrolling, facilitating
                  consistent and accurate performances.
                </p>

                <h2>What TRN is not for:</h2>
                <p>
                  TRN encourages memory-based performances. By design, it does{' '}
                  <em>not</em> provide:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>No dynamics/articulation</li>
                  <li>No tempo/metre/bars</li>
                  <li>No technique instructions</li>
                  <li>No repetition counts</li>
                  <li>No tablature</li>
                </ul>

                

                <h2>Author Background</h2>
                <p>
                  Hi! I'm Maika, the creator of The Remind Notation. TRN emerged
                  from my frustration with online chord lookups. Interrupting
                  play to scroll was a hassle, and auto-scroll rarely worked. I
                  wanted a better online option, where a song's chords fit on
                  one page. Whether performing live, rehearsing, or jamming,
                  that's all I needed. So, I created TRN.
                </p>

                  <strong>Q: Is this the final product?</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                  A: No, this is a proof of concept for educational purposes.

                  <strong>
                    Q: How is TRN different from other musical notation?
                  </strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                  A: TRN omits time and dynamic indicators, focusing on chord
                  and structure reminders. It encourages personal interpretation,
                  making it ideal for jam sessions.

                  <strong>
                    Q: Can TRN be used for complex chord progressions or
                    unconventional song structures?
                  </strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                  A: TRN is versatile but may not cover every intricate
                  progression. It suits standard formats best. For complex
                  compositions, explicit notation may be needed.

                </p>
                <p>

                  structure, making it accessible regardless of language.
